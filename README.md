## üìà Overview

WealthVision is a comprehensive financial tracking application that gives you a clear, real-time view of your entire financial picture. By securely connecting to your financial institutions through Plaid, WealthVision provides an intuitive dashboard to monitor your net worth, track spending patterns, and set financial goals.

## üåü The WealthVision Story

WealthVision was developed through an incredible "vibe-coding" session on Replit. What makes this project remarkable is how it was built from scratch in a single, fluid development process:

- **Zero to Hero**: The entire application ‚Äì from concept to fully functioning wealth tracker ‚Äì emerged in essentially one continuous development flow
- **Seamless Integration**: Plaid API integration, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, authentication system, and daily background jobs were all implemented with remarkable cohesion
- **Rapid Development**: The project demonstrates the power of modern development tools and platforms, showing how complex financial applications can be built efficiently

What would have taken weeks or months with traditional development approaches was accomplished in a fraction of the time, without sacrificing quality or features. This project stands as a testament to the capabilities of Replit's collaborative development environment and modern web technologies.
